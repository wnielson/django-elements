django-elements
===============

``django-elements`` is a reusable application for `Django`_ projects that seeks to
provide a way to make publishing rich-text content on the web easy for the
end-user.  Instead of requiring the user to write in HTML (or worse, use a
`WYSIWYG`_ editor), ``django-elements`` uses a superset of the human-friendly
`Markdown`_ syntax.  The standard Markdown syntax has been extended with a
powerful macro system (similar to the macro syntax used in `Trac`_) via
`markdown-macros`_.  Since a picture is worth 1000 words, here is an example of a
document written with ``django-elements``:

.. _Django:           http://djangoproject.com/
.. _WYSIWYG:          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG/
.. _Markdown:         http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
