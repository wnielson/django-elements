django-elements
===============

This application is designed to provide an easy way to embed arbitrary objects
into textual content.  Text is written in [Markdown][] and objects can be inserted,
as either inline or block-level elements, using a simple [Trac-like macro][]
syntax.  For more details check out the [docs][].
